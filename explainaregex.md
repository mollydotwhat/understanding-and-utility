`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/` 
<!--or hexcode: `/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`, depending on which one I can explain most clearly... -->

## Regex Components

### Anchors

characters that are anchors: '&', '^'. (the ones inside the quotes)
`^` goes before exact string to match, or if you put them in brackets you can have a list of matches.
first anchor `^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)` where ^ means that from a to z, 0 to 9, or underscore matches. The use of characters `()`, `+`, `\.-` will be explained in later sections.

'$' means match the string in FRONT of the anchor. Works with brackets the same as above.


### Quantifiers
limiting, but also greedy/lazy
+ at end means as many as possible/available
in `^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)` the `+` asks it to match *every* time one of the characters inside the `[]` is present.

### Grouping Constructs
`()` capturing group

### Bracket Expressions
Brackets are for a range of characters to match. For example, `[this]` will match all of these: ink, share, heatwave, and teapot.
carat *inside* brackets means *exclude* those characters.

### Character Classes

### The OR Operator

### Flags

### Character Escapes
